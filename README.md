DESCRIPTION: 

Muser is a portable multimedia player written purely in Java, and stylized with CSS. Currently Muser is only compatible with .mp3 and .wav files, but I hope to eventually make it compatible with other audio formats and file types.

The GUI is written using JavaFX, and colored with some simple CSS. I hope to pretty it up the future.

This release of Muser is REALLY REALLY bare-bones. The UI is also really bare minimum at the moment as well. In truth this is really just a proof of concept at the moment, but I hope to get this going somewhere in the future. But for what is here right now it's pretty good.

Other than that compile it and run it like any other java application.

Or just run the .jar file...
