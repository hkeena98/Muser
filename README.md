# Muser

Author: Henry Keena

Release: 1.0

Date of Release: 5/25/2019 

License: MIT

GitHub: https://github.com/hkeena98/Muser

DESCRIPTION: 

Muser is a portable multi media player written purely in Java, and stylized with CSS. Currently Muser is only compatible with .mp3 and .wav files, but I hope to eventually make it compatible with other audio formats and file types.

The GUI is written using JavaFX, and prettied up with some simple, configurable, CSS.

FILES INCLUDED:

1. Muser.java
2. Song.java
3. PlayList.java
4. LICENSE.txt
5. README.md
6. PNG Icon Files
7. styles.css
8. tika-core-1.9.jar
9. tika-parsers-1.9.jar
10. compile.sh

TODO:

1. Implement the playlist selection/build system
2. Make a nicer GUI design
3. Make a progress bar for the playing song
4. Implement support for .ogg files, and other sound file formats
5. Implement jar file building into the compile script

Third-Party Inclusions:

1. PNG icon images are from Celcius Creative: https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/music-player-black
2. Apache Tika Toolkit .jar files: https://tika.apache.org/


INSTALLATION:

The simplest way to install and run Muser, is to run the compile.sh script. You can also create a executable .jar file for Muser, I plan to implement this into the compile script eventually.
